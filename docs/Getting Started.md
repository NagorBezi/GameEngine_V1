# Getting started
When creating a game, only 2 folders should be of your concern:

* /games
* /shaders

The 'games' directory has game.cpp, which is your game file. Any custom c++ files should also be here, if you prefer to code like that.

The 'shader' directory is where you keep the GLSL shaders. Two pretty basic shaders are provide: shader1.vs (Vertex Shader) and shader1.fs (Fragment shader). You can make your own shaders, if the basic whens dont suite you.
